# Pelican ASF Website

See [ASF-Pelican](https://infra.apache.org/asf-pelican.html)

See [migration notes](migration/README.md)

## Tools folder

The Tools folder from ASF CMS is copied to [tools](tools). These need to be adapted to Git based processes. See [migration notes](migration/README.md).

## Security content

Vulnerability pages are generated by a shell script [`content/security/vulnerabilities.sh`](content/security/vulnerabilities.sh) which runs other shell scripts.
These generate html in md files along with the full json.

I recommend that this script be included in the release process.

Shell and python script files are ignored by the build.
