This directory contains a set of scripts that help dealing with GitHub PR's for
backports or PR's created for review before merging into trunk.
These scripts require the following tools (details in the script headers):

- curl
- svn
- git
- hub
- jq

* create_pr.sh:
  This script creates a pull request against the 2.4.x branch to backport
  the given Subversion revisions from trunk.

* apply_backport_pr.sh: 
  This script applies the pull request <PR number> to the Subversion working
  copy of the branch. It works best with PR's created by create_pr.sh.

* apply_trunk_pr.sh:
  This script applies the pull request <PR number> to the Subversion working
  copy of the trunk. 

More details can be found at the top of the scripts.
